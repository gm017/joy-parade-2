Hello!!! IT'S AVERY OBVIOUSLY
How did you end up here?
This is my bedroom,
get out!!!
But since you're here
could you help me find Julliete?
I think she said
that she was going up the tower
Thank god Jeff is
dead though hehehe
But I am worried about her,
it's a scary tower.
I'm honestly 
very very scared of it.
I think she was looking
for something.
Why are you holding
that hammer?
You must be a 
painter and decorator I guess.
Cool job!
It's good to learn a trade.
Good for you 
I suppose.
You're seeing floating
objects in your visual field?
Sounds like there's something 
wrong with your brain.
That's a real downer 
I am sorry to hear that.
There is a discord
group you can join.
They say fasting cures most
physical and mental ailments
So far there have been
zero success stories.
And a number of people who
say it made their symptoms worse.
But you have to understand
that they did their refeeding wrong.
Too much sugar!!!
anyway...
Please help me find
Juliette.
She really is the
love of my life!!
