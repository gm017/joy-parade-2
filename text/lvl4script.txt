Hey you made it up here!
Nice view right ??
Thanks so much for coming over 
to help me with this co-write! 
I am thinking... you honestly will 
break your neck like a kingfisher !
If you do not 
GET IT TOGETHER !!
We're setting up 
the tank Shots.
Please don't tell those
birdwatch purists about this. 
They are stuck in
the 20th century.
we are moving forward 
to the future..
..with what we're doing 
with these cameras today.
You need to jump right off
and into the tank.
I will snap the pic
as you splash down.
Watch your neck!
i really mean it..
My one still being made
is a Direware Tailwhip.
Tricked out with copper 
snakeskin fat carbon showside.
Mokume inlays on lockside,
copper (pivot collar, inlay backspacer)
and zirconium (pocket clip) accents.
Plus DW's signature
camo blast on the 
titanium and blade
Blade is Magnacut. 
Should be pretty stunning. 
Better be. Lol.
