it looks different here
than what i remember
do you remember?
.. when we got stuck for hundreds
of years. generations and generations.
it felt like we were clay
pots turning and grinding 
getting folded in like dough
how was your christmas?
my custom knife biz is going good
maybe this one could be like 
a freemanontheland perspective
tv license goon community quasi
liberatarian weapons law reform
that kiiiiiiiiind  of 
thiiiiiiiiing??????
not that i believe in it
not one bit
but could be interesting
idk....
that clay pot transformation
thing seems like a joke now
but it felt so real at the
time do you remember?
we were stuck 
for so long......
