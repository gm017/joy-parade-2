It looks different
here than I remember.
Do you remember?
when we got stuck years?
It felt like generations 
to me.
Turning around in cicles,
for such a long time.
Seems kind of funny now
doesn't it?
How was your Christmas?
I'm still doing my knives.
Maybe this one could be like a
free man on the land kinda thing
Licensing goon community outrage
UK weapons law reform kind of thing?
that kiiiiiiiiind  of 
thiiiiiiiiing??????
not that i believe in it
not one bit
but could be fun
idk....
that transformation
thing seems like a joke now
but it felt so real at the
time do you remember?
we were stuck 
for so long......
OK i'm going to push you
off into the tank now
are you sure you're
ready?
It's going to be 
different down there...
Are you
ready?
