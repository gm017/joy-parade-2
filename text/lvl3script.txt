Did you find it?
Please help me.
It's a two-tone
Cartier santos.
Why are you making
that horrible noise as you move?
You are crawling along the
ground like a disgusting beetle.
Can you not
stand up?
VILE !!
HORRIBLE !!
You'll never find my watch 
scuttling around like that!
Do you think you'll be able 
to crawl up the tower?
Maybe we could hang out...
I don't know...
Did you hear those
threatening voices?
They said they were
going to come up the lift...
Into our bedroom 
and take all your things.
